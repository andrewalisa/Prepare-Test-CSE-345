          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>In the U.S., this system evolved in the first part of the 20th century. Standardized tests today did not design this system themselves. Poor teaching is not the result of bad standardized testing scores. The problem is the system does not allocate proper preparing time for the standardized tests. The system does not value getting a good score on your
          standardized test. We always say: Hate the game, not the player. </p>

          <h2>Vision </h2>
          <p>Learning science research lets us answer this question. We know a lot about skill learning. We need to visualize exams that implement research findings.
          We know what the format of the exams will be like, we need to figure out how they are made. First, exam authors need to learn about learning. Then they need tools to make effective exams. We need to know what those tools look like. </p> 
  
       </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p>It doesn't have to be this way. We offer a valuable tool to our end users, which allows them to take practice tests. In turn, the more the user practices, the higher they will score on their standardized tests, which will increase funding to the local public schools. Who doesn't want more money for their local school? After all, if our kids succeed, then we all succeed as a society. </p>
